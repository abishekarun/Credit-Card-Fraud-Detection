## Credit Card Fraud Detection 

In this project, we try to identify the fradulent applications for credit card using hybrid model consisting of 
self orgainizing maps and neural network.This project was done as a part of Deep Learning A-Z course on Udemy.

The Jupyter notebook with the hybrid model (SOM + NN) can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/master/hybrid_som.ipynb).
